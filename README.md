# bopbip-essentials mod

If you don't have a dedicated server, become the server. 
Using a GitHub repository, you can share a single world with friends, allowing any player (with the link and key) to host or join a running instance of the shared world.
This mod enforces one host at a time to make sure there are no conflicting edits.

This mod is meant to be used alongside [Essential](https://essential.gg/), which allows you to host a singleplayer world with friends.

## Dependencies

- [oÏ‰o (owo-lib)](https://github.com/wisp-forest/owo-lib)
- [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu)

## How to use

1. Either download the jar from release or compile from source.
2. A GitHub repository is required to share the world, here's [bopbip-world](https://github.com/chimkenu/bopbip-world) for reference (a normal minecraft world with a `host.txt` file).
   This repo has to already have the world and host.txt file ready.
3. Create a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
4. Add the link and personal access token in the bopbip-essentials config using Mod Menu.
5. Now you can click the bopbip button!
